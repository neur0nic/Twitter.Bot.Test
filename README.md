# Twitter.Bot.Test

The try to built my own twitter bot (just for fun).

The description tells if the bot is online or not.

You can ask him questions. So far he answers to these questions

1) "Tell me a joke" - Responses with one of 37 puns
2) "Tell me the time" - Responses current time
3) "Tell me the discordian date" - Responses the current discordian date
