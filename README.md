# Twitter.Bot.Test

The try to built my own twitter bot (just for fun).

The description tells if the bot is online or not.

You can ask him questions. So far he answers to these questions:

1) "Tell me a joke" - Replies with one of 37 puns
2) "Tell me the time" - Replies current time
3) "Tell me the discordian date" - Replies the current discordian date
4) "Play russian roullette" - Plays Roussian Roullette till someone dies
5) "Tell my fortune" - Replies with a fortune cookie text from <a>dein-glueckskeks.de</a>
