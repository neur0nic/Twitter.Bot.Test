# Twitter.Bot.Test

The try to built my own twitter bot (just for fun).

The description tells if the bot is online or not.

It retweets all of its followers.

You can ask it questions. So far it answers to these questions:

1) "Tell me a joke" - Replies with one of 37 puns
2) "Tell me the time" - Replies current time
3) "Tell me the discordian date" - Replies the current discordian date
4) "Play russian roullette" - Plays Roussian Roullette till someone dies
5) "Tell my fortune" - Replies with a fortune cookie text from www.dein-glueckskeks.de
6) "My name is Guybrush Threepwood. Prepair to die" - Replies with an insult
